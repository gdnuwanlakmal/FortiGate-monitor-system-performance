# Monitoring FortiGate System Performance with 'diagnose sys top'
The diagnose sys top command on a FortiGate firewall is used to monitor system performance in real time, similar to the top command in Linux. It provides a live view of CPU and memory usage by processes running on the device.

```shell
diagnose sys top
```
